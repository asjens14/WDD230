<h2>tranforms</h2>
<b>Transform</b> property allows for rotating, scaling, and/or skewing any element on the page
Multiple transformations can be declared using a space separated list

<h3>translation</h3>
Allows elements to move left, right, up, down

        Transform: translate(x, y)
        Transform: translateX()
        Transform: translateY()
	
<h3>scaling</h3>
The <b>scale(x,y)</b>function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically
If one value is provided, it is used for both

        Transform: scale(x,y)
        Transform: scaleX()
        Transform: scaleY()

*Scaled elements grow and shrink from center

*Has no impact on document flow

<h3>rotation</h3>
<b>rotate()</b> rotates an element around the point of origin
*Angles are declared in degrees; positive = cw, negative = ccw

<h3>skew</h3>
<b>skew(x,y)</b> specifies skew along an axis
If the second parameter is excluded, skew will only happen on the x axis

<h3>changing the origin of transform</h3>
The origin from which transforms are applied can be changed using the <b>transform-origin</b>property
Same syntax as <b>backgroung-position</b>
Defaults to center of the object


*order of transform matters
If you rotate before translating, the translate will be on the rotated axis

<h2>transitions</h2>
Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, providing simple animations
CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on an element

Steps to create a simple transition using CSS:
<b>1.</b>declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration
<b>2.</b>declare the final state of the element
<b>3.</b>include the transition functions in the default style declaration using the transition properties, including:
        transition-property
        transition-duration
        transition-timing-function
        transition-delay

<b>transition-property</b> defines the CSS properties of the element to be transitioned
Any property changing from one value to another you can find a valid midpoint for can be transitioned
*exception is visibility

<b>transition-duration</b> sets how long the transition will take
Can be declared in seconds or milliseconds
200ms is considered the optimum time for a transition

<b>transition-timing-function</b> lets you control the pace of the transition in more granular detail
Most common timing function key terms:
	Ease - slow start, then speeds up
	Linear - constant speed
	Ease-in - starts slow, then accelerates
	Ease-out - starts fast, then slows down
	Ease-in-out - similar to ease, but accelerates more sharply at the start
	
<b>transition-delay</b> makes it possible to introduce delay before the transition begins
*a negative time delay that is less than the duration of the transition will cause it to start immediately, but start part way through

<h3>the transition shorthand property</h3>
The four transition properties can be combined in to the <b>transition</b> property
        .ad-ad2 h1 span {
            transition-property: transform; 
            transition-duration: 0.2s;  
            transition-timing-function: ease-out;
            transition-delay: 50ms;
        }

Becomes
        .ad-ad2 h1 span {
            transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
        }

<h3>multiple transitions</h3>
The <b>transition</b> property also allows for multiple transitions in one call
To properties transition at different rates, or for only a few to have a transition effect, 
include them as a comma separated list including transition-property and transition-duration for each

        transition-property: transform, color; 
        transition-duration: 0.2s, 0.1s;  
        transition-timing-function: ease-out, linear;
        transition-delay: 50ms;

Shorthand can also be used to specify multiple transitions

        transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms, color 0.1s linear 50ms;

To change both at the same rate, property names can be used, or use the <b>all</b> keyword
When using the all keyword, all the properties transition at the same rate, speed, and delay:

        transition: all 0.2s ease-out 50ms;


<h2>animations</h2>
CSS animations allow you to control each step of an animation using keyframes
A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition

<h3>keyframes</h3>
To animate an element, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block.
To create an animation, use the @keyframes rule for IE10+ and FF16+ followed by a name of your choosing, 
which will serve as the identifier for the animation. Then, you can specify your keyframes.

        @keyframes myAnimation { 
        /* put animation keyframes here */
        }

Each keyframe looks like its own nested CSS declaration block
Instead of a traditional selector, you use percentage values
The two key terms are <b>from</b> and <b>to</b> - evaluate to 0% and 100% respectively
These values specify how far along the animation each keyframe is located.

Include the properties to animate inside each keyframe, along with the animated values
*keyframes can be in any order. Percentage values determine order

Animation examples:

        @keyframes moveRight { 
            from {
                transform: translateX(-50%);
            }
            to {
                transform: translateX(50%);
            }
        }

        @keyframes appearDisappear { 
            0%, 100% {
                opacity: 0;
            }
            20%, 80% {
                opacity: 1;
            }
        }

        @keyframes bgMove {
            100% {
                background-position: 120% 0;
            }
        }

<h3>animation properties</h3>
<b>animation-name</b> - used to attach an animation to an element
<b>animation-duration</b> - defines the length of time an animation takes to complete one iteration
<b>animation-timing-function</b> - determines how the animation will progress
Options are the same as for transition-timing-function, with step-start, step-end, and steps(number,direction)

*background images can't be animated, but background-position is.
The <b>steps()</b> function moves the background image through the background box

        .ad-ad3 :after {
            content: '';
            width: 90px;
            height: 92px;
            background-image: url(../images/bike_sprite.png);
            display: block;
            margin: auto;
        }
        @keyframes bike {
            0% {
                background-position: 0 0;
            }
            100% {
                background-position: -360px 0;
            }
        }

        animation-timing-function: steps(4, end);

<b>animation-iteration-count</b> - lets you define how many times the animation will play through
<b>animation-direction</b> - Can be used to change animation direction
	<b>normal</b> - 0% to 100%
	<b>Reverse</b> - 100% to 0%
	<b>alternate</b> - 0% to 100%, then 100% to 0%
<b>animation-delay</b> - define how many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the animation begins
<b>animation-fill-mode</b> - defines what happens before the first animation iteration begins and after the last iteration ends
Values are:
	None
	Forwards
	backwards 
	Both
<b>animation-play-state</b> - defines whether the animation is running or paused

<h3>the shorthand animation property</h3>
The <b>animation</b> property takes a space separated list of values

        .verbose {
            animation-name: appearDisappear; 
            animation-duration: 300ms; 
            animation-timing-function: ease-in;
            animation-iteration-count: 1;
            animation-direction: alternate;
            animation-delay: 5s;
            animation-fill-mode: backwards;
            animation-play-state: running;
        }

        /* shorthand */
        .concise {
            animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;
        }

    <div class="content">
<h2>canvas</h2>
The canvas API allows shapes and lines to be drawn using javascript

<h3>creating a canvas element</h3>
Add a canvas element to the page. Text in between is shown if canvas is not supported
Add an ID
Takes both a width and height attribute, which must be set
Add a border

<h3>drawing on the canvas</h3>
Before drawing, you need to grab the canvas element
<h3>getting the context</h3>
Once the element is in a variable, set up the context, where the drawing is rendered
Done by calling the getContext() method and passing it the string "2d"
<h3>filling brush with color</h3>
Saturate brush with color using the strokeStyle or fillStyle properties
strokeStyle and fillStyle are set on a context object, and both take one of three values: a string representing a color, a CanvasGradient object, or a CanvasPattern object.
Stroke can be thought as the border of the shape
Define stroke color using strokeStyle
Define fill color using fillStyle

*<b>the canvas coordinate system</b>
The coordinate system is different for the canvas
If the canvas is 200 by 200:
Top-left is (0,0)
Bottom-right is (200,200)

<h3>variations on fillStyle</h3>
Instead of color, you can use a CanvasGradient or a CanvasPattern object

To create a CanvasGradient, use <b>createLinearGradient()</b> or <b>createRadialGradient()</b>
X0 and y0 represent start point
X1 and y1 represent end point
Specify color stops. Offset 0 is start, offset 1 is end

<h3>drawing other shapes by creating paths</h3>
Paths create a blueprint for lines, arcs, and shapes, but are invisible until given a stroke
With complex shapes, there are 3 steps to take:
<b>1.</b>layout the path
<b>2.</b>stroke the path
<b>3.</b>fill the path

An arc is created using the <b>arc()</b> method
Arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise)

<h2>SVG</h2>
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML
Unlike bitmaps, vector images preserve their quality even when blown up or shrunk down

*XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language

<h3>drawing in SVG</h3>
Drawing a circle in SVG is easier than drawing a circle with canvas

        < svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 400 400"></svg>
        < circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red"/>
        < /svg>

The <b>viewbox</b> attribute defines the starting location, width, and height of the image
The <b>circle</b> element defines a circle, with cx and cy the X and Y coordinates of the center
Radius is represented by r
Fill defines the fill style

<h3>canvas vs SVG</h3>
Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, but operates in immediate mode
This means if you want to add more to the canvas, you can't add to what is already there
After drawing a shape, canvas no longer has access to it, because id doesn't persist as an object
If you want to add more, the new shape must be drawn from scratch
No access to what is drawn via the DOM

What is drawn in SVG is accessible to the DOM, because it operates in retained mode
The structure of the image is preserved in the XML document that describes it
Since SVG is a file format, you can't manipulate SVGs the way you can manipulate pixels in canvas

<h2>drag and drop</h2>
This API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over, or dropped onto other elements

Steps to adding drag and drop to a page:
<b>1.</b>set the <b>draggable</b> attribute on any html elements you'd like to be draggable
<b>2.</b>add an event listener for the <b>dragstart</b> event on any draggable html element
<b>3.</b>add an event listener for the <b>dragover</b> and <b>drop</b> events on elements you want to have accept dropped items

*draggable is not a boolean attribute, so it has to be set explicitly to true

<h3>the DataTransfer object</h3>
These objects allow us to set and get data about the elements that are being dragged
DataTransfer lets us define two pieces of info:
	The type of data we're saving of the draggable element
    The value of the data iself
