    <h1>Mastering Mobile UX Notes</h1>
    <pre>
        How to Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX
            • If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content and your core functionality
            • Other way around = putting marshmallow in a piggy bank = !beautiful & !simple
            • Responsive != mobile first
            • Responsive retrofitting -> desktop to mobile
            • Desktop sales have been declining/mobile sales have been increasing
            • Mobile is not a fad
            • Start small and scale up
            
        How to Improve UX by Understanding Users
            • It's really hard to design products by focus groups - people don't know what they want until you show them
            • 3 things you can do to make a difference
                ○ (Immediate)Be there - help move someone along their decision journey, and deepen their loyalty
                ○ (Relevant)Be useful - only 9% of users will stay if it doesn't satisfy their needs
                ○ (Frictionless)Be quick - it's not about fast loading, the functionality must be there as well
            • Reachability matters
                ○ 75% of people rely on thumbs
                ○ 49% use 1-handed grip
            • Speed matters
                ○ Reduce image usage
                ○ Optimize and minify CSS and JS files
                ○ GZIP files
            • Networks matter
            
        Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design
            • Software sucks
            • Primary controls
                ○ Menu/controls on bottom = easier to reach
            • Placement matters
                ○ Address reachability issues
                ○ Created perception of speed
                ○ Improved engagement
                ○ Increased satisfaction
            • Perception matters
            
        Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms
            • Make it simple so people can use it easily
            • Errors happen
                ○ Entering information from a mobile device tends to be tedious and error prone
                ○ Enable autocomplete
            • Passwords matter
                ○ Amount of typos caused by masking the password is staggering.
                    § Causes businesses to lose money
                    § Masking doesn't help with security
                ○ Sow passwords, but allow user to hide them
            • Present users with the best keyboard for the task at hand
                ○ Numbers - bring up number pad
            • Calls matter
                ○ Don’t force a copy and paste
                
        Designing a better Mobile Advertising User Experience
            • End-users, not technologies, shape the market.
            • Before you advertise, research
            • If you have pop-ups or in between ads when reading content, you are doing it wrong
            • Pop-ups ads are the most hated things on the web
            • Things you can do to make mobile ads nicer
                ○ Make ads in content small and simple
            • The fallen state of our internet is a direct, if unintentional, consequence of choosing advertising as the default model to support online content and services - Ethan Zuckerman
            • Things to remember
                ○ Stop using pop-ups/pop-overs
                ○ STOP USING POP-UPS/POP-OVERS
                ○ Users don't visit your website to look at ads
                ○ Keep it simple and sleek
        Make sure it's unobtrusive - content first
