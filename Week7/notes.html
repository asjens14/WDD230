      <h2>function properties and methods</h2>
      The <b>call()</b> method can be used to set the value of <b>this</b> inside a function to an that is provided as the first argument.
      
      <h3>call and apply methods</h3>
      function sayHello(){
      return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`;
      }
      We can create some objects that have a name property, then use the call() method to invoke the sayHello() function, providing each object as an argument. This will then take the value of this in the function
      
      const clark = { name: 'Clark' };
      const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' };
      sayHello.call(clark);
      << 'Hello, my name is Clarke'
      sayHello.call(bruce);
      << 'Hello, my name is Bruce'
      
      If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as arguments after the first argument, which is always the value of <b>this</b>
      
      function sayHello(greeting='Hello'){
      return `${ greeting }, my name is ${ this.name }`;
      }
      sayHello.call(clark, 'How do you do');
      << 'How do you do, my name is Clark'
      sayHello.call(bruce);
      << 'Hello, my name is Bruce'
      
      If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() method, but needs to be provided null as its first argument.
      square.call(null, 4)
      << 16
      
      The apply() method works in the same way, but the arguments of the function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument:
      
      square.apply(null, [4])
      << 16
      
      <h3>memoization</h3>
      A feature that provides result caching
      If a function takes time to compute a return value, the result can be saved in a <b>cache</b> property.
      If the same argument is used later, the cached value can be returned.
      
      function square(x){
      square.cache = square.cache || {};
      if (!square.cache[x]) {
      square.cache[x] = x*x;
      }
      return square.cache[x]
      }
      
      
      
      <h2>immediately invoked function expressions</h2>
      An <b>Immediately invoked function expression</b> is an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it's defined
      Easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition
      Has to be made into an expression by placing the whole declaration in parentheses
      
      (function(){
      const temp = 'World';
      console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);
      })();
      << 'Hello World'
      
      <h3>temporary variables</h3>
      Variables can't be removed from scope once declared
      If a variable is needed temporarily, it might create confusion if it's still available
      Name may also clash with another piece of code
      Placing inside an IIFE will allow it to only be available while the IIFE is invoked
      
      let a = 1;
      let b = 2;
      (()=>{
      const temp = a;
      a = b;
      b = temp;
      })();
      a;
      << 2
      b;
      << 1
      console.log(temp);
      << Error: "temp is not defined"
      
      <h3>initialization code<h3>
      An IIFE can be used to set up code that will not be needed again
      Will be invoked once, and can set up any variables, objects, and event handlers when the page loads
      
      <h3>self contained code blocks>
      An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any other part of the program.
      Using IIFEs in this way means code can be added or removed separately
      
      (function() {
      // block A
      const name = 'Block A';
      console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);
      }());
      (function() {
      // block B
      const name = 'Block B';
      console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);
      }());
      <<  Hello from Block A
      Hello from Block B
      
      Both blocks contain a name variable, but don't interfere
      
      
      <h2>functions that define and rewrite themselves</h2>
      A function can not only call itself, but define and redefine itself
      Done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function
      
      function party(){
      console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
      party = function(){
      console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
      }
      }
      
      If the function is also assigned to another variable, this variable will maintain the original function definition and not be rewritten
      This is because the original function is assigned to a variable, then within the function, a variable with the same name as the function is assigned to a different function.
      
      function party(){
      console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
      party = function(){
      console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
      }
      }
      const beachParty = party; // note that the party function has not been invoked
      beachParty(); // the party() function has now been redefined, even though it hasn't been called explicitly
      << 'Wow this is amazing!'
      party(); 
      << 'Been there, got the T-Shirt'
      beachParty(); // but this function hasn't been redefined
      << 'Wow this is amazing!'
      beachParty(); // no matter how many times this is called it will remain the same
      << 'Wow this is amazing!'
      
      
      <h2>recursive functions</h2>
      A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a condition is met
      Useful when iterative processes are involved
      
      function factorial(n) {
      if (n === 0) {
      return 1;
      } else {
      return n * factorial(n - 1);
      }
      }
